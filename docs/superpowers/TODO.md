# Adventure — Open work

Only open items live here. The full completed history (Specs 1–5, the UI
redesign phases, the test-isolation saga, the 2026-07 maintenance passes)
moved to [TODO_ARCHIVE.md](TODO_ARCHIVE.md). The 2026-07-27 repo audit that
drove the `repo-health` branch is at
[plans/2026-07-27-repo-health-review.md](plans/2026-07-27-repo-health-review.md).

## Gameplay — waiting on playtest verdicts
- [ ] Tune `EVENT_TUNING` (app/dungeon/room_events.py): shrine/trap/ambush
      counts, trap damage/DC, ambush pack size, respawn interval/cap.
- [ ] Mana economy: skill costs 4/8/12 vs mana potion +5 — potion likely
      wants a buff now that casting drains.
- [ ] Spawn density / `aggro_radius` play-feel tuning.
- [ ] Combat-screen visual redesign (deliberately deferred to a live
      session with the user).
- [ ] Live-browser confirmation of room events: shrine icon on canvas,
      trap message on step, ambush pack appearing, respawn trickle.

## Engineering
- [ ] Shrine/camp write `stats["mana"]` instead of `current_mana`
      (pre-existing camp convention) — post-combat characters may not see
      the restore; small cleanup.
- [ ] Multi-worker Socket.IO (sticky sessions + message queue) — only if
      `--workers > 1` ever becomes real.
- [ ] Application-factory refactor: kill import-time side effects
      (load_dotenv/DB/migrations/seeds on `import app`). Spec:
      [specs/2026-07-27-app-factory-refactor-design.md](specs/2026-07-27-app-factory-refactor-design.md).
- [ ] Exception-handling ratchet: 63 silent handlers remain (CI enforces
      via `fix_exception_handling.py --check --max-count 63`). Lower the
      number as modules get cleaned; never raise it.
- [ ] Opportunistic god-file splits: `dungeon_api.py` (~1.8k lines),
      `combat_service.py` (~1.7k), `admin_new.py` (~1k), `adventure.js`,
      `combat.js` — extract when next touched for a feature.
- [ ] Remove dead `glass-theme.css` purple body-class rules (confirm
      `admin_themes.html` doesn't use them first).
- [ ] Dedupe `equipment.js` vs `equipment-enhanced.js` (near-identical
      encumbrance/gear-bonus helpers; check whether plain `equipment.js`
      is still loaded at all).
- [ ] `.pre-commit-config.yaml`'s `optimize_svgs` hook never runs: its
      `files: '\\.(svg)$'` regex is the same doubled-backslash bug class
      documented in pyproject.toml's black include. Fixing the regex will
      make it rewrite every SVG on the next run — do it as its own commit
      and eyeball the asset diff.
- [ ] Fold the duplicated HP/mana-cap math in
      `combat_service._derive_stats` and
      `dashboard_helpers.build_party_payload` onto `compute_hp_mana_max`.
