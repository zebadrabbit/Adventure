"""Dungeon generation invariant tests.

These tests are intentionally lightweight and focus on structural integrity
rather than exhaustive statistical properties.

Invariants covered:
1. No orthogonally adjacent doors (prevents double-width doorway artifacts).
2. Every door has at least one ROOM neighbor and one walkable (ROOM/TUNNEL/DOOR/LOCKED_DOOR) neighbor.
3. Start room (room_types[0] == 'start') exists and its interior center is walkable.
4. (Soft) All non-start rooms are either reachable or explicitly counted in metrics['unreachable_rooms'].
5. Secret doors are not walkable until revealed; locked doors are treated as walkable.
